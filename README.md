# Music-App
A Django Based Music App I created to practice my Backend Skills and 
get a better understanding of CSS, JS, Bootstrap and Django.

**purpose**
Open a custom web app, upload and enjoy your favorite songs

**Workflow**
I started by creating a new app in Django, wrote a template in HTML5
and Boostrap. I wrote a CSS template to get the look of the web page itself
and a JS module.

**Compilation Steps**
In the terminal, run python3 manage.py runserver
copy the web address into your browser
enjoy the music ; )
